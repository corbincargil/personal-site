In the previous post, I wrote about my switch from the construction industry into tech. I mainly talked about how I went about learning to code and I also gave some _hopefully_ helpful advice on things I wish I would've known/done different. Now I want to focus more on the why, which I think is often more important than the how when it comes to big decisions. Here it is:

Over the course of three summers and over a year post-graduation, I worked for a variety of sub-contractors and general contracors in the construction industry, gaining some great experience in project engineering and project management. I had the opportunity to meet and get to know some great people from all over the country, and developed a deep appreciation for the countless hours of work that go in to building and maintaining our modern infrastructure. I got to work on a variety of job sites from apartment buildings, grocery stores, and research facilities to wind farms, hydroelectric plants, and 40,000 sq. foot dams.

Seeing a project evolve from the early stages of construction to completion over the course of months or years was always one of my favorite parts of the job. You show up to the site day-in and day-out, and before you know it the entire site looks entirely different. What started as some design drawings on a piece of paper comes to life right before your eyes. While I sometimes miss this aspect of the construction industry, this same concept is one of my favorite parts of software engineering, specifically web development.

At this point, I have been building web apps for more than 2 years and have now been working full-time as a software engineer for over 3 months. And one of my favorite aspects continues to be seeing a project transform from a concept or idea into a finalized product. However, instead of only being on the management side of the process, I now get to help build something that didn't previously exist using my own hands (keyboard). Not only am I still getting to use my engineering mindset to come up with solutions to problems, but I am now the one to actually implement these changes into the project in a way that I didn't usually get to.

I know that building a React component that handles form validation is not the same as creating a 200 foot long staff guage with c-channel and reinforced concrete, but getting to use my creativity, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail to provide a good user experience is a process that brings me that same sense of satisfaction while also allowing me to take pride in my "craftsmanship" and refine a skill in a manner I didn't used to previously. I consider myself very blessed that I have this opportunity and am looking forward to continue to learn and grow as a developer.

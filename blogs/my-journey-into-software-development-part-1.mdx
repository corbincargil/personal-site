It all started on a normal Saturday morning in the summer of 2020...

Just kidding. I'm not gonna go that far back into the details in this article, but maybe I will some other time. Today, I just wanted to talk about my experience in switching careers from being a project engineer in the construction world to software engineering üë®‚Äçüíª. The focus will be a little more on the 'how' than on the 'why', although I will talk about the 'why' in a separate post.

```
For anybody who is curious about making a career switch into software, my goal is to make this post insightful while providing some practical advice.
```

I want to start by explaining my approach/process before moving on to some advice I would recommend for anyone thinking about learning how to code. Before I do any of that though, I would like to take this time to thank Riley & Clara Miller for being there to answer tons of my questions and help me along the way. I definitely don't think I would have made this career change if it weren't for them. I also want to thank my brother, my sister, and my parents. They were the best support group I could've asked for and each one of them helped me achieve this goal of mine (and without them I wouldn't have had anybody to reluctantly test any of my portfolio projects and give feedback üòÖ).

## My journey

When I first started out, I had no idea what all software engineering entailed or the vast variety of jobs that are considered to be in the world of 'software engineering'. I just knew I liked coding and wanted to try giving it a shot as a potential job. I also didn't have any coding experience other than a MATLAB course I almost had to retake in college.

So before I started learning I decided to do some research and see if I could find what sort of job I'd be interested in within the realm of software engineering. From there, I was able to learn what technologies and language(s) would be the most useful for me to learn. Eventually I decided that web development was the most interesting to me, and that meant that HTML, CSS, and Javascript would need to be the technologies I focused on first. I was also confident that I eventually wanted to end up using React and make that my tool of choice for building web apps. So after getting that established, I felt that I was ready to get started!

One of the first resources I used was The Odin Project. It is a website & curriculum that is catered towards people with little to no coding experience, is focused on web development, and is completely free. A perfect fit for what I was trying to do! One of my favorite aspects is that it is based largely on building your own projects as the primary method of learning (which I talk more about below). It also points you to the right places for further learning and covers a wide range of topics, starting at the very fundamentals and progressing all the way up to building a full-stack web app. I worked through most of this program and was able to learn while building up my portfolio at the same time.

After I had worked through much of The Odin Project, I wanted to go deeper into building up my skill set with React. I had heard of Kent C. Dodds from friends and seen some of his articles/videos by this point, so I decided to see what other resources he had out there. I continued my learning by taking concepts I picked up from some of Kent's resources and integrating them into both new and old projects. Using his website and other resources he has online, I was able to take my knowledge in React much deeper and increase my understanding of some of the possibilities that can be achieved using this framework.

From there, I used my existing portfolio to put together a resume and start applying to jobs. I started out by keeping count of how many jobs I applied to and what the company/position were. However, I stopped tracking that after 100 and kept on applying. I had around 20 phone and zoom interviews before getting my first job offer. Overall, it took me about 5 months of applying before landing a job. And I had been studying and working on my portfolio for 7 months before that. It was a long process with plenty of ups and downs along the way, but it is one that I would highly recommend to anybody that is curious about making a switch to software engineering. Below you can find some advice that I would recommend to anybody wanting to learn to code!

## My advice

This next section contains what I think would be helpful tips for anyone looking to learn to code or get a job in tech. I don't think there is a right or wrong way to go about it but hopefully I can provide some advice (in no particular order) that you might not have considered:

        * Learn by building üî®:

        This was some advice that I received from my friend Riley and I believe this was one of the most helpful tips that allowed me to stay consistent and actually enjoy the learning process over the course of 10+ months. Watching videos, reading documentation, and working through exercises in code sandboxes all have their place and were normally where I started when learning a new concept. However, as soon as I felt like I had the fundamentals down, I would try implementing what I had just learned in a project (either new or existing). Working on projects was probably how I spent ~75% of my time when making my career change. This approach has multiple benefits.
            1) First and most importantly, it makes learning to code fun. The coolest thing about learning to code is the ability it gives you to take an idea for a project you have and turn it into a real-world app. Even if all it is is a basic calculator or tic-tac-toe game (both of which are projects I did üòâ), it is so rewarding to see your efforts pay off when building something with what you've learned.
            2) The process of applying a concept and working through the bugs and mistakes I would often make when trying to apply it was what actually helped me to retain the new information. It can be tough to learn something new and then try applying it right away, but the struggle of picking apart a concept to track down a bug and getting it to work is how I often learned the best.
            3) Not only does it help you track your progress, but it allows you to build a showcase for future employers. You will often hear that building a portfolio is a major part of landing that first job, and this is obviously very true. So why not work on your portfolio early and often by frequently adding new projects and refactoring existing ones with new concepts you learn?


        * Consistency is key üîë:

        You don't have to spend 8 hours/day, 5 days/week, to get a job. But you do have to continue to learn and grow, and the best way to do this is actually not to pull an all-nighter once every couple weeks when that wave of motivation hits you. Instead, I found that building a routine of working for an hour or two at a time, 3-5x/week got me further than spending an entire day coding 1x/week. That being said, the more time you are willing to put in the more you will get out of it, but the key is to be consistent.

        * Get plugged in üîå:

        There are so many communities out there filled with people trying to learn programming, so take advantage! This was not something I did a great job of, but is something that I wish I would've been better about. I was fortunate to have some friends I could talk to when I had small questions, but I think that getting involved in an actual community would have helped me early on. Not only can you ask people for help with specific/technical questions, but you can also help others that are stuck with something you have struggled with in the past.

## Summary

At the end of the day, I believe that anyone can learn to code with the right help and enough time! I highly encourage that anybody considering making a switch into software development (whether as a hobby or career) give it a shot and see where it goes üöÄ. With the amount of resources out there that are free and open to the public, it can't hurt!

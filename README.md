# Personal Portfolio Site

## Description:

This porfolio site showcases some of my favorite projects I've built, skills I've added to my developer toolkit, and my current learning. It also includes  my bio and a contact form if you want to connect with me. Eventually, I would like to add more pages for blogs, hobbies, or anything else. 

## Live Preview: 

The live site can be accessed here:

## Lessons Learned: 
* Further practice building with Gatsby
* Deeper understanding of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Accessability best practices
* Image optimization for static and dynamic images and lazy loading to boost performance
* Practice using Styled Components
* Mobile-first devlopment so ensure readability on all platforms

## Reflection: 
When beginning this project, I wanted to treat it like a project for a client, so I started with a thorough design before any code was written. From there, I had a pretty good idea of the tech stack I wanted to use, but made sure to clarify anything still outstanding. I was unsure how I wanted to style the site and handle the contact form, but ultimately decided to use Styled Components and Netlify's built in form-handling features. Next step was starting with a Gatsby project and beginning to put content on the page. Because I already knew most of the components I would need, this went pretty fast for the most part. Styling went slower than expected because I had never used Styled Components before. Once I got the hang of it, I ended up really liking the organization that comes natually by styling with Styled Components. With most of the content and styling done, I added parallax effects for the section headers and the animated background from Vanta. The part that took me the longest and had the biggest learning curve was using GraphQL for dynamic and static images that were optimized by Gatsby. Looking back, I would have saved myself a lot of time by implementing these features from the beginning instead of adding plain <img> tags and going back to optimize them. I also spent a decent amount of time getting the SEO, Accesibility, and performance as high as possible. The lowest scoring metric is the performance due to the animated background at the top of the page (which I learned through trial and error). The initial page load has not given me problems on Chrome or Firefox, but is sometimes slow on Safari. Overall, I learned a lot more than I thought I would building this site, and am happy with how it turned out. Be on the lookout for more features/updates in the future!

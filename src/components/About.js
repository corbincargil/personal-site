          from Colorado School of Mines. I've created this platform to document
          my progress üìà as I expand my skills and knowledge in web development.
          I have a passion for learning, problem-solving, and building
          applications with modern technologies (my favorite is probably React
          ‚öõÔ∏è). While I have a strong background in front-end technologies, I am
          currently cultivating a deeper appreciation for server-side 
          programming at my{" "}
          <a href="https://ksensetech.com/">current company</a>, where I am
          gaining valuable experience with full-stack web apps. When I'm not
          working or coding, I usually spend time with family or friends. Some
          of my hobbies include reading üìö, working out üèãÔ∏è, and watching chess ‚ôü
          tutorials on Youtube.

          Hi, I‚Äôm Corbin. I am a self-taught software developer born & raised in
          south Texas and based in San Antonio. After majoring in mechanical
          engineering at Colorado School of Mines, I began building my
          programming skills as a hobby by taking online classes and working on
          the occasional project while working full time. This soon led me to
          realize my passion for using problem solving and *technology* to
          develop software solutions for those around me. I love learning,
          building, and getting creative, all of which I use sofware development
          as an outlet for. When I‚Äôm not at my computer, I enjoy working out,
          spending time with family & friends, and reading. I also really enjoy
          watching movies/TV, but try to not spend too much time inside if I can
          help it.
